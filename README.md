# PokeMon Black Market
 ##### The application is named "PokeMon Black Market," offering a complex yet enjoyable web experience for PokeMon enthusiasts and collectors. Users can choose to either buy PokeMon directly at a premium price or acquire Poke Balls at a fraction of the cost for a chance to "Encounter" PokeMon in the wild. The "Encounter" feature serves as a mini-game, allowing users to use their purchased PokeBalls to catch PokeMon that appear in this section of the app.
##### Once a user has acquired or caught PokeMon or purchased a PokeBall, they can conveniently view their collection in the user profile section. Additionally, users have the option to search for a specific PokeMon directly on the "Find PokeMon" page by entering the name or National PokeDex ID.
